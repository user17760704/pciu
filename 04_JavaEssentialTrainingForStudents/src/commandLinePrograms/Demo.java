/**
 * 
 * The goal of this exercise to run this particular program through the command line
 * JAVA_HOME should be set as a system environment variable. in command line, 
 * java -version should return a version.
 * 
 * Once this is set, copy the text without the comments and package declaration and
 * create a new class through a text editor and paste the contents. I will make the assumption
 * that the class is created in C:\temp
 * 
 * Navigate to C:\temp through command line. 
 * 
 * Run the following commands - 
 * 
 * javac Demo.java (This should create class file in the same directory)
 * java Demo (This is not the file name, just the class name, so no extension is needed)
 * 
 * This should print an output: 
 * 
 * Hello world!
